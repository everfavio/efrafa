### 1. Auxiliary verbs

We use be, have and do to form tenses, questions and negative forms, and we use themin short answers, questions tags, etc.
<!--more-->

In all the case they are called auxiliary verbs.

- We use be (+ verb + -ing) to form continous tenses.

    __Present continous__: HeÂ´s studying to become a doctor.

    __Past Continuous__: I was talking to Charles the other day.

- We use have (+ past participle) to form __perfect tenses.__.

    __Present perfect:__ We'__ve been__ here for three months.

    __Past Perfect:__ The film __has started__ when we got there.

- We use do in __simple tenses__ (in the question and negative forms).

    __Present Simple:__ __Do__ all your family live rount here?

    __Past Simple:__ i __didn't__ get your email.

### 2. Auxiliary verbs in questions

- In continous and perfect tenses, __questions__ are formed by __inventing__ the subject and auxiliary verb.

    __Is he__ sudying to become a doctor?.

    How long __have your brother and sister__ lived here?
- In __simple tenses__, we add do/does or did (see above).

### 3. Wh- questions

- We form many questions with wh- words and phrases.
